# 🏠 Project 3: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 🎯 Objective:
To build a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on features like size (sq ft), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location (zip code).

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, evaluation metrics)

## 📊 Dataset:
- Name: `final_dataset.csv`
- Source: Public dataset (loaded from GitHub)
- Features: `beds`, `baths`, `size`, `zip_code`, `price`

## 📋 Steps Performed:
1. Imported and explored the dataset
2. Checked for missing and duplicate values
3. Visualized data with correlation heatmaps and scatter plots
4. Selected features and split the dataset into training and test sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using R² score and Mean Squared Error
7. Visualized predicted vs actual prices

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- House size and number of bedrooms had the strongest influence on price.
- The model was able to predict prices with decent accuracy and explained a good portion of the price variance.
- Some predictions deviated from actual values due to outliers or regional price variation by zip code.
- This model is a strong base for more advanced regression analysis in real estate.

## ✅ Outcome:
Successfully built and evaluated a house price prediction model using linear regression. This project demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning in business and property valuation.
