## 📁 Project Title:
Retail Sales EDA – Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship

## 🎯 Objective:
To perform exploratory data analysis on a retail dataset to identify trends, patterns, and business insights regarding sales and profit across different product categories, regions, and sub-categories.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Dataset:
Sample - Superstore.csv  
(Source: Kaggle - Superstore Dataset)

## 🧪 Steps Performed:
1. Imported and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned duplicates and checked for missing values
3. Analyzed sales and profit by:
   - Region
   - Category
   - Sub-Category
4. Visualized key trends using bar plots, scatter plots, and horizontal bar charts

## 📊 Visualizations:
- Sales vs Profit Scatter Plot (colored by Category)
- Sales by Region Bar Chart
- Profit by Sub-Category Horizontal Bar Chart

## 🔍 Key Observations:
- Sales do not always indicate profit — some high-sale products result in losses.
- 'Tables' and 'Bookcases' sub-categories showed negative profits.
- Technology category provides the highest profit margins overall.
- Western region performs best in terms of overall sales.
- Some low-volume categories like Binders still generate high profit.

## ✅ Outcome:
Successfully performed EDA on the retail dataset and extracted meaningful insights that can help drive business decisions like discount strategy, regional marketing, and product selection.
