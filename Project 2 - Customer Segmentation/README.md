# 📊 Project 2: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📁 Project Title:
Customer Segmentation – Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship

## 🎯 Objective:
To segment customers into meaningful groups based on their income and spending patterns using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies and better understand customer behavior.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)

## 📌 Dataset:
**Mall_Customers.csv**  
(Source: Kaggle – Mall Customer Segmentation Data)

## 🧪 Steps Performed:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned and standardized the data
3. Visualized gender distribution and income vs spending patterns
4. Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
5. Implemented **K-Means Clustering**
6. Visualized the customer segments

## 📊 Visualizations:
- Gender distribution bar chart
- Spending Score vs Annual Income scatter plot
- Customer segments plotted by cluster

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- Cluster 0 represents high-income, high-spending customers — ideal for premium targeting.
- Cluster 2 includes low-income, low-spending individuals — minimal ROI expected.
- Cluster 4 contains moderate-income, high-spending customers — strong loyalty potential.
- Cluster 3 are high-income but low-spending — engagement needed to activate them.
- Cluster 1 includes younger customers with varied spending — good for personalized offers.

🎯 These clusters help businesses refine marketing strategies, product placements, and offer personalization.

## ✅ Outcome:
Successfully grouped customers into 5 distinct segments using K-Means Clustering. The analysis enables actionable insights for business decision-making and targeted marketing.
